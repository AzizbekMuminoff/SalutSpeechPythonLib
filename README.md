from salutspeech import SalutSpeechAPI

api_key = 'your_api_key_here'
salut_speech = SalutSpeechAPI(api_key)

Synthesizing Speech

To synthesize speech from text:

python

response = salut_speech.synthesize_speech("Привет, как дела?", "ru")
print(response)

Recognizing Speech

To recognize speech from an audio file:
